# Alarm Test 1

This app works on both Android and iOS. On the main page, there's a textfield and a button. When the button is clicked, it will schedule a notification based on the number on the textfield. For example, if the textfield has a number '5', the notification notification will be scheduled to appear after 5 seconds.
